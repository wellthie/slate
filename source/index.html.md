# Introduction

Welcome to the Wellthie Business API Documentation.

Authentication is implemented using the `devise-token-auth` gem. Visit their docs [here](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/devise_token_auth) for more information.

In the curl examples you'll see on the right, when trying to execute those on the command line, remember to add a particular host with the appropriate organization_slug. For example: `http://wellthiedemo-smallbusiness-test.lvh.me:3030`.
